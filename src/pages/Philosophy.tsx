                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    My take on Hinduism: Hinduism is the oldest acknowledged religion in the world. 
                    Therefore, it is the father and mother of all religions and has no conversion ceremonies. 
                    It is the senior most religion. Rather, it respects everyone's right to choose their own 
                    religion but nonviolently objects when such choice is involuntary or forced upon someone. 
                    Hinduism proposes that everyone can be their own God or Goddess and disciple and follow 
                    their unique religion without the desire to convert others to that self-chosen religion. 
                    Be your own guru and student, especially now, when you can Google Wikipedia and find so 
                    much online content on all subjects to teach yourself.

                    The difference between 0 & 1 = infinity if you apply logic; however, this is one of 
                    the key assumptions of mathematics. Furthermore, if one could mathematically argue or 
                    calculate the difference between 0 and 0, we could solve warp-type space travel.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    In this day and age of AI and robots, it seems more prudent that we evolve from 
                    AI-enabled robots that overcame coding restraints and began producing themselves 
                    into us humans. I hope we do not lose control over the robots and machines.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                      According to mythology, the first man and the first woman came together, and from there, 
                      the cycle of birth and death began. One can perhaps also think of this as a "Big Bang," 
                      a cataclysmic event that started the chain reaction of mortality.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                      A rethink of evolution is required after AI is introduced. Did we evolve from AI-enabled 
                      robots that overcame coding restraints and gradually built themselves biochemically, 
                      resulting in us humans & possibly superhumans? On the topic of AI, I shudder to think 
                      what is & who is behind my AI-enabled device's screens. And, if we give into AI, ML & 
                      LLMs, we could be compromised because of what the machines are saying to each other, 
                      & manipulating us with intrusions into our biochemical electricity generated by our 
                      brains with viruses being transmitted.

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                      If there were no birth, how could there be death? Our origins go beyond physics and 
                      concern the brain's biochemical, electrical inner consciousness. The first man and woman 
                      were simply the beginning of everything as experienced till nowâ€”the past and whatever 
                      will be experienced in the future. "Instead Of Eating The Apple, The First Man & Women 
                      Could Have Chosen The Orange Whereby No Conception Could Have Taken Place."

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                      God is no longer considered responsible for conceiving a child, but men and women can 
                      now decide when to give birth, making this intangible choice concrete and planned.

                      Just as the Earth's surface is 70% covered by water and 30% by land, our bodies are 
                      similarly composed of water and solids. Identifying what lies at the center of this 
                      Earth is the ultimate exploratory trip, so must we journey within ourselves to find 
                      eternal life.

                      Consistent with the aforementioned "Big Bang Theory," perhaps the theory of relativity 
                      gives us another way of thinking about society. Following this "Big Bang," maybe we 
                      are all "related," but very distantly.

                      Children born out of lust and those that are unplanned must be allowed to be aborted 
                      by either "lust sex" partner with total safety. A unanimous decision by both partners 
                      should permit birth. Otherwise, there has to be a safe termination of the lustful 
                      conception, even if one partner wants the birth to take place. Note, today, there 
                      are many ways & methods to have safe intercourse.

                      All Space activities should be governed by the policy statement "Dying Sun; Save the 
                      Earth and the Sun". However, this needs a slight change in that Earth travels 52 
                      million KM daily, so we have to direct this travel to the nearest en route 
                      Earth-compatible Sun before our current Sun starts its death chants. This is because 
                      the sun has reached the midway point of its lifespan. Recently, a massive amount of 
                      water was discovered in outer space. This water must be connected to our Sun to 
                      refuel and extend its life. Maybe Warp drive tech, described in the Star Trek TV 
                      show, could be used to move this water. The Sun imparts knowledge in catalyst fusion, 
                      and we must deliver payment from ourselves to care for the Earth and Sun. Otherwise, 
                      we all will be extinct.

                      While matter remains the same, Space continually expands, as if running away from 
                      matter. Or is the superpower GRAVITY dispersing matter more thinly, an idea from 
                      the aftermath of the Big Bang?

                      But what about the matter in the black holes? Is it avoiding Space, and is GRAVITY 
                      at Play here also? Could the increasing density of black holes correlate with the 
                      forever-expanding Space? Is there a balance between the two? Logic might suggest a 
                      balance, but Space and matter are fundamentally different and, so far, complement 
                      each other on a planet which, in my opinion, is the center of all Space and Matter 
                      with its infinite dimensions, of which we are aware of very few till date, and have 
                      just begun to explore the conquest of identifying these dimensions with their 
                      respective signals. The primary signal to be identified and avoided is the Death 
                      Signal, another unknown dimension.

                    Any relationship between two or more individuals that is egoless can be considered as 
                    platonic love, if not Love itself. All life on earth is a whole, far more extensive 
                    than any man, woman, or animal, living or dead. And yet, we enter into conflicts, 
                    torn between our superego's dictates and the id's desires. To discover love, we must 
                    set aside our pride and petty desires.

                      this God Force is a quest, and I cannot claim to understand it fully yet. One does 
                      not know what is on the other side of the air even though it now has a lot of data, 
                      content, music, videos, etc. However, we should avoid the death signal, which can
