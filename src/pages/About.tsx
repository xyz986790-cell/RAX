                    Employees generate value for their employer until payday. In his view, a valid

                    Marketing & Competition
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Competition is often misunderstood as a negative term, but this does not have to be the case.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    For example, consider a hypothetical scenario: let us assume that everyone in the world already owns a TV. 
                    This can be considered TV market saturation or full supply. Until this point is reached, manufacturers 
                    can focus their marketing efforts on those consumers who do not use TVs. Once market saturation has been 
                    reached, manufacturers then focus on releasing new models, persuading consumers to buy more than one TV 
                    for their homes, or upgrade their devices.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We are familiar with the traditional seven "P's" of marketing: 1) product; 2) price; 3) place; 4) promotion; 
                    5) people; 6) process; and 7) physical evidence. However, there is an additional "P" that could be considered 
                    the most important: "Providing Money." This refers to providing producers and consumers with the means and 
                    resources (money) to produce and/or acquire products or services. If this is implemented in relation to a 
                    specific product or service, it can ensure its viability even in a highly competitive market. The availability 
                    of money in every market enables producers and consumers to engage with newly launched or introduced goods, 
                    products, and services.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    "PURR," which stands for "Product Usage Responsibility Regulations," should also be included as one of the 
                    essential considerations. In the marketing process, it is essential to clarify the target audience for the 
                    product or service and how it should be used responsibly. For instance, the manufacturers of RDX (a powerful 
                    explosive) are responsible for its usage, whether it is for peaceful purposes or otherwise.

                    Hinduism is considered to be the oldest religion in the universe. It is about embracing the role of being 
                    the parent of all religions, with the freedom to choose and practice any religion within oneself. Each 
                    individual is seen as their own god and disciple. What religion did one belong to 1400, 2024, and 4000 
                    years ago? This belief system does not involve conversion ceremonies or efforts to spread the religion 
                    through conquest. While Hinduism has a history of war, today followers strive to practice non-violence 
                    and avoid conflict.

                    As progress in machine learning, LLM, IOT & artificial intelligence (AI) advances, do labour, staff & 
                    management in relevant industries or sectors, face unemployment? For example, has the keyboard been replaced 
                    already & data entry operators & typists have been laid off? Or, is this a ploy to hook us to the companies 
                    that create this tech, just like we are hooked to Windows?

                    bio-chemically configured themselves as humans are today. I hope our IT techies, of whichever nationality 
                    now, have not sold us off, and can return with their assets, & build their current environment back home
